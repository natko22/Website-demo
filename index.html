        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>A designer plays a key role in a creative company. Using elements
            like typography, illustration, photography and layouts, a designer
            always has an extremely creative mind that can absorb visual
            trends and deploy them in fresh and exciting ways. Our Creative
            and Design team know all there is to know about getting a designer
            job, including the leading agencies where you can excel, and how
            to get you the very best opportunity.
